 The Presidents Cup 2013 is one of the worlds greatest golfing events. The competition is held biennially and is not an individual golf competition. The Cup sees two teams challenge each other. Biennially it is the United States versus The Rest of The World (excluding Europe). The last Presidents Cup was was held in Melbourne Australia in 2011 at the Royal Melbourne Golf Club with tremendous success. The 2011 champions were The United States. This years event its going to be held in Muirfield Village, Dublin, Ohio (not Ireland) and promises to be an exciting action packed golf tournament!
The Presidents Cup 2013 will start this Thursday and continue on throughout the weekend with 34 matches in all. I know football is happening but this should be a really great event and who doesn't want to see?
