<span style="color: #cc0000;"><b>USA</b></span><br />
<br />
Tiger Woods-Matt Kuchar: Expect Woods to play with Kuchar, his longtime partner Steve Stricker and Jason Dufner.<br />
<br />
Steve
 Stricker-Jordan Spieth: The veteran (Stricker) with the impressive 
rookie (Spieth). The two played a practice round at Tour Championship, 
where they each tied for second.<br />
<br />
Keegan Bradley-Phil Mickelson: Why break up this team, which went 3-0 at the 2012 Ryder Cup?<br />
<br />
Bill Haas-Webb Simpson: The Wake Forest grads have similar games.<br />
<br />
Jason Dufner-Zach Johnson: 2-1 in 2012 Ryder Cup as a team.<br />
<br />
Brandt Snedeker-Hunter Mahan: Great putter (Snedeker), great iron player (Mahan).</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="color: #cc0000;"><b>Internationals</b></span><br />
<br />
Ernie Els-Brandon de Jonge: Els is the only
 player on the team to celebrate an Internationals victory. His 
experience will help de Jonge, a rookie, who led the PGA Tour in birdies
 this season.<br />
<br />
Adam Scott-Hideki Matsuyama: The Masters champion 
(Scott) will be a calming influence on the rookie, who played well in 
the majors this year.<br />
<br />
Charl Schwartzel-Louis Oosthuizen: The two 
major champions, World Cup teammates and longtime friends played amateur
 golf with/against each other.<br />
<br />
Jason Day-Graham DeLaet: Day is a member at Muirfield Village and is coming off another solid year. DeLaet had his best season.<br />
<br />
Angel
 Cabrera-Marc Leishman: Two big bombers on a course that plays well to 
the longest hitters. Cabrera (Masters runner-up) has plenty of 
experience.<br />
<br />
Richard Sterne-Branden Grace: Two rookies have played
 on the big stage together and play well together. Sterne has six wins 
on the European Tour. </div>
